# Welcome to my GitHub, here's a little about me: 👋
## 🎯 Brief Summary
### My name is Annabel Andrews, I am 23 years old living in Clearwater, Florida! 🌴 I graduated from University of South Florida in Tampa in 2024 with my Bachelor's in Applied and Computational Mathematics. I have many vastly different interests as you will read about but I am primarily focused right now on bringing my wide range of skills together to start my career in Actuarial Science / Risk Analysis. 

## 🎯 Currently working ON:
### Studying for SOA Exam P 📖, strenghtening Python and SQL skills 👩‍💻, and building a portfolio of projects ✍. 
### Most of my time outside of my 8-5 is spent on studying probability theory, random variables, statistical distributions, and calculus in hopes to one day become an actuarial scientist. My current goal is to take the exam in September 2025! After that, I plan on taking Exam FM (financial mathematics). 

## 🎯 Currently working AS:
### An accounting assistant for a PEO company 💸 
### I clean / organize / structure data and keep track of an extensive amount of financial information and tax requirements for hundreds of clients in 24 different states. I create financial reports for audits and compliance reviews, and I find errors in payroll processing for individuals and analyze our records (i.e. check history, identification data, tax rates, insurance benefits) to create unique solutions for each problem. Most of my work here is using excel -- VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, importing math formulas -- as well as our own payroll and bank software. I work with a team of 9 people, constantly collaborating on issues, automation strategies, delegating assignments, and staying perfectly organized. In accounting, being off by two cents on one ledger could mean dozens of problems down the road for our team.  

## 🎯 What have I done?
### In high school, I served as the secretary officer for my school's mathematics honor society, Mu Alpha Theta, took AP, AICE and Dual Enrollment classes, and served as the Vice President for my school's performing arts honor society, International Thespians. Ever since I was a kid I have had the same passions: math, science, art, music, dance, and theater. Very random interests, I know. I have also been working part-time in the food service industry since I was 16, starting as a hostess at Olive Garden and working my way up to becoming a head bartender at Bonefish Grill at 21 where I still currently work on the weekends. This is where I learned how much I love hospitality; directly making connections with people in my community (or people I may never see again.) Getting to know people as individuals from all kinds of places, and making a positive impact in their life even if its as small as bringing out a good meal is a new, huge, passion of mine. 
### In 2018, in my junior year of high school Category 5 Hurricane Michael decimated my hometown and my school. We finally got back to our campus for a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic my senior year. I still graduated in 2020 with my AICE diploma, and began my University Career at USF in Tampa FL, originally as an Engineering Major. I graduated in 4 years in May 2024 despite the setbacks. 
### Throughout college, I worked full-time at Bonefish Grill as a server, bartender, and keyholder manager. I was also a full time student. My high school passions, college ambitions, and current lifestyle have taught me a lot about time-management, keeping my goals organzied, and how to effectively delegate my work-energy to maximize my own productivity. It's safe to say, I am a workaholic.
